First post

We had a successful club last night and booked the next event for 2.2.2016.

One of the main objectives of the club is for each member to have their own blog by the end of the sixth session.

Here is my first post.

I wanted to log our actions as it is so easy to get lost once things get started.

It is also very difficult to know what to write, so here is a stream of consciousness piece.

We started with introductions, thankfully David and Sarah had this covered, as I was a teensy bit late.

I had run from a code club elsewhere in london, so by the time I got there most things were pretty under way.

Sarah is the mozilla community manager and was responsible for ensuring along with a great team that Mozilla festival ran without a hitch.

We had met the day before to settle my nerves, and discuss the general direction of the meeting.

David is a fellow mozillan and serial volunteer at mozfest and also is currently chomping his way through the freecodecamp syllabus found here:

Paul is  a fellow #cgjam mentor and has experience of setting up websites, including his new site:

http://sonicpimentor.com/

Then we had our two new recruits who found each other working through programming courses at work and decided to expand into a more social learning experience.

Their main experience had come from here:

https://www.codecademy.com/

As I am aiming to get this published I'm going to keep this quite short, but first a quote:

“ Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. ” - Martin Fowler

Steps to create this blog

Create a gmail account:

You can use any mail account, but sometimes the path of least resistance is beneficial and google accounts do carry the advantage of google docs etc:

https://accounts.google.com/SignUp

mozclub.uk.london.central@gmail.com

Da Da!!!

With this create a git hub account:

mozclub-uk-london-central

You might like to follow the first steps found here and learn how to create a change to a file and understand the workflow in a github project:

https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Somehow I managed to create two pull requests, a bit happy with the button clicking possibly?

Then I was presented with two links to explore:

1. https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html

2. https://github.com/explore

You might instead just go ahead and start your blog with the instructions here:

https://pages.github.com/

The blog account is mozclub-uk-london-central so our website repo will be called mozclub-uk-london-central.github.io

It's a bit of a longie but I wanted the option of other clubs having repos in a similar form ie mozclub region area.

This reflects the coderdojo methodology if you elect to have one of those at any time.

You could use the command line, but for all you click happy gooey guys, here's the alternative:

Find your repository and click new file.

In the blank box type index.html

On line one type:

 Hello World

Stick with the a simple commit title like:

Created index.html

You can also add some additional text:

I hope we see this site at http://myname.github.io

I'm going to push this file up so I can't procrastinate about it.

vSo on the site you will see an index.html file with a link to tutorial.txt

I'll add the markdown later ;)

Bye for now!
